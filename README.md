## PatientQueue

#About the project
This program is to assist 24 hour urgent care walk-in clinic with an upgrade of the patient management system.
It classifies patients using 4 urgency levles, with level 1 being the least urgers and level 4 being the most urgent. 
The amount of time it takes a doctore to treat a patient depends on the patient's urgency level.

By using FIFO queue, enqueue and dequeue is called based on the dynamically-sized circular array.
